A vue.js spa with vuex, typescript and webpack

## Getting Started

**Clone/Download the repo:**

Fork this repo from GitHub or simply download the `.zip` bundle
with the content inside.

#### Dependency installation

Download and install [Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for
Windows or for Mac.

#### Project installation and server

Now you've pulled down the repo and have everything setup, using the terminal
you'll need to `cd` into the directory that you cloned the repo into and run
some quick tasks:

```
cd <vue-persons-app>
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

This will then setup all the development and production dependencies you need.

#### Development server
Now simply run this to start up the server:

```
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```
The webpack-dev server is using json-server as a fake backend. The db.json
is used like a database where you can read and write to. For more information
you can check the link on the bottom of the page.

Visit `localhost:8080` to see the app running.
